# C Mini Project 

This is my 2nd sem C project.
The project is "Matrix Calculator"

## Initialization

We will be using structures to store information about a 2D array 
1) The 2D array itself 
2) Row length of the 2D array 
3) Column length of the 2D array
## Implimentation
Creating seperate functions for 
1) Inputing an array into the array of structures
2) Addition of arrays
3) Subtraction the arrays 
4) Inverting the arrays 
5) Dividing the arrays
6) Multiplication of arrays 
7) Scalar Multiplication on an array
8) Determinent of the array 

while loop is used to track the option entry
